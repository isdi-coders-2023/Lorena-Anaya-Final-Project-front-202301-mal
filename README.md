ðŸŸ¢ BTC365 Projects Application Front End ðŸŸ¢

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.
This is the front-end for the web application BTC365 Projects.

The purpose of this application is to allow the translation agency BTC365 to manage translations in an easy way. The admin can create projects and assign them to the different translators that are registered. This way, admin and translator can both see the main information regarding the management of a project: due date, languages (from and to) and number of words. The admin can also upload the document to be translated by the translator, and the translator can upload the document when translated.

ðŸ”¸The language in which this app is programmed is Typescript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

ðŸ”¸To implement dynamic routing in the web app react-router-dom npm package is used (https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

ðŸ”¸In order to keep the code clean and follow best practices, these tools are used:

-Husky hooks (https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

-Eslint (https://eslint.org/)

-Code formatter Prettier (https://prettier.io/)

-SonarCloud (https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/)

-Editorconfig

ðŸ”¸Testing is also done through all the project, with the help of:

-React Testing Library (https://testing-library.com/)

-Jest (https://jestjs.io/)

-Mock Service Worker (https://mswjs.io/)
